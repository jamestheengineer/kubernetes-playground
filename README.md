Playground to learn kubernetes.

First example is from https://www.learncloudnative.com/blog/2020-05-26-getting-started-with-kubernetes-part-1/, which is a great overview of kubernetes basics from scratch.

Second example is from https://medium.com/@markgituma/kubernetes-local-to-production-with-django-1-introduction-d73adc9ce4b4, which covers creating a cluster with Django, PostgresSQL, Redis, and Celery.
